      "                        The long range of airborne drones helps them perform critical tasks in the skies. Now MIT spinout Open Water Power (OWP) aims to greatly improve the range of unpiloted underwater vehicles (UUVs), helping them better perform in a range of applications under the sea.Recently acquired by major tech firm L3 Technologies, OWP has developed a novel aluminum-water power system that’s safer and more durable, and that gives UUVs a tenfold increase in range over traditional lithium-ion batteries used for the same applications.The power systems could find a wide range of uses, including helping UUVs dive deeper, for longer periods of time, into the ocean’s abyss to explore ship wreckages, map the ocean floor, and conduct research. They could also be used for long-range oil prospecting out at sea and various military applications.With the acquisition, OWP now aims to ramp up development of its power systems, not just for UUVs, but also for various ocean-floor monitoring systems, sonar buoy systems, and other marine-research devices.OWP is currently working with the U.S. Navy to replace batteries in acoustic sensors designed to detect enemy submarines. This summer, the startup will launch a pilot with Riptide Autonomous Solutions, which will use the UUVs for underwater surveys. Currently, Riptide’s UUVs travel roughly 100 nautical miles in one go, but the company hopes OWP can increase that distance to 1,000 nautical miles.“Everything people want to do underwater should get a lot easier,” says co-inventor Ian Salmon McKay ’12, SM ’13, who co-founded OWP with fellow mechanical engineering graduate Thomas Milnes PhD ’13 and Ruaridh Macdonald '12, SM '14, who will earn his PhD in nuclear engineering this year. “We’re off to conquer the oceans.”“Drinking” sea water for powerMost UUVs use lithium-based batteries, which have several issues. They’re known to catch fire, for one thing, so UUV-sized batteries are generally not shippable by air. Also, their energy density is limited, meaning expensive service ships chaperone UUVs to sea, recharging the batteries as necessary. And the batteries need to be encased in expensive metal pressure vessels. In short, they’re rather short-lived and unsafe.In contrast, OWP’s power system is safer, cheaper, and longer-lasting. It consists of a alloyed aluminum, a cathode alloyed with a combination of elements (primarily nickel), and an alkaline electrolyte that’s positioned between the electrodes.When a UUV equipped with the power system is placed in the ocean, sea water is pulled into the battery, and is split at the cathode into hydroxide anions and hydrogen gas. The hydroxide anions interact with the aluminum anode, creating aluminum hydroxide and releasing electrons. Those electrons travel back toward the cathode, donating energy to a circuit along the way to begin the cycle anew. Both the aluminum hydroxide and hydrogen gas are jettisoned as harmless waste.Components are only activated when flooded with water. Once the aluminum anode corrodes, it can be replaced at low cost.Think of the power system as type of underwater engine, where water is the oxidizer feeding the chemical reactions, instead of the air used by car engines, McKay says. “Our power system can drink sea water and discard waste products,” he says. “But that exhaust is not harmful, compared to exhaust of terrestrial engines.”With the aluminum-based power system, UUVs can launch from shore and don’t need service ships, opening up new opportunities and dropping costs. With oil prospecting, for example, UUVs currently used to explore the Gulf of Mexico need to hug the shores, covering only a few pipeline assets. OWP-powered UUVs could cover hundreds of miles and return before needing a new power system, covering all available pipeline assets.Consider also the Malaysian Airlines crash in 2014, where UUVs were recruited to search areas that were infeasible for equipment on the other vessels, McKay says. “In looking for the debris, a sizeable amount of the power budget for missions like that is used descending to depth and ascending back to the surface, so their working time on the sea floor is very limited,” he says. “Our power system will improve on that.”Nailing the designThe OWP technology started as the co-founders’ side project, which was modified throughout two MIT classes and a lab. In 2011, McKay joined 2.013/2.014 (Engineering System Design/Development) taught by MIT professor of mechanical engineering Douglas Hart, a seasoned hardware entrepreneur who co-founded Brontes Technologies and Lantos Technologies. Milnes, who was previously a systems engineer at Brontes and co-founded Viztu Technologies, was Hart’s teaching assistant.The class was charged with developing an alternate power source for UUVs. McKay gambled on an energy-dense but challenging element: aluminum. One major challenge with aluminum batteries is that certain chemical issues make it difficult to donate electrons to a circuit. Additionally, the product of the reactions, the aluminum hydroxide, sticks to the electrode’s surface, inhibiting further reaction. Continuing the work in 10.625 (Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage), taught by materials science Professor Yang Shao-Horn, the W. M. Keck Professor of Energy, McKay was able to overcome the first challenge by making a gallium-rich alloyed aluminum anode that successfully donated electrons, but it corroded very quickly.Seeing potential in the battery, Milnes joined McKay in further developing the battery as a side project. The two briefly moved operations to the lab of Evelyn Wang, the Gail E. Kendall Professor of Mechanical Engineering. There, they began developing electrolytes and alloys that inhibit parasitic corrosion processes and prevent that aluminum hydroxide layer from forming on the anode.Setting up shop at Greentown Labs in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 2013 — where the company still operates with about 10 employees — OWP further refined the power system’s design. Today, that power system uses a pump to circulate the electrolyte, scooping up unwanted aluminum hydroxide on the anode and dumping it onto a custom precipitation trap. When saturated, the traps with the waste are ejected and replaced automatically. The electrolyte prevents marine organisms from growing inside the power system.Now OWP’s chief science officer, McKay says the startup owes much of its success to MIT’s atmosphere of innovation, where many of his professors readily offered technical and entrepreneurial advice and allowed him to work on extracurricular projects.“It takes a village,” McKay says. “Those classes and that lab are where the idea took shape. People at MIT were doing strong science for science’s sake, but everyone was keenly aware of the possibility of bringing technologies to market. People were always having those great ‘What if?’ conversations — I probably had three to four different startup ideas in various stages of gestation at any given time, and so did all my friends. It was an environment that encouraged the playful exchange of ideas, and encouraged people to take on side projects with real prizes in mind.”Topics: School of Engineering, Mechanical engineering, Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&E), Startups, Alumni/ae, Oceanography and ocean engineering, Drones, Autonomous vehicles, Security studies and military, Oil and gas, Batteries, Energy, Energy storageUPI reporter Brooks Hays writes about MIT spinout Open Water Power, which developed a battery that can be powered by seawater.

It is powered by more than 1,000 lithium-ion batteries - similar to those used in laptop computers, though adapted for extreme pressures - which allow it to dive up to 20 hours.

As their (autonomous) name suggests, AUVs operate independently of humans. AUVs have no physical connection to their operator, who may be on shore or aboard a ship. Rather, AUVs are self-guiding and self-powered vehicles.AUVs may glide from the sea surface to ocean depths and back. Others can stop, hover, and move like blimps or helicopters do through the air. Solar-powered AUVs can spend a portion of their time at the surface, blurring the distinction between undersea and surface vehicles.AUV systems can be small, easily portable vehicles under 100 pounds or they can be long-endurance gliders or very large systems. The largest AUVs in service weigh thousands of pounds and require their own dedicated support vessels.Fully autonomous operations carry power onboard. Power enables propellers or thrusters to move an AUV through the water and is necessary to operate sensors on the AUV. Most AUVs use specialized batteries, although some AUVs have used fuel cells or rechargeable solar power. Certain AUVs, such as gliders, minimize energy demands by allowing gravity and buoyancy to propel them.AUVs are attractive options for ocean-based research. AUVs can reach shallower water than boats can and deeper water than human divers or tethered vehicles can. Once deployed and underwater, AUVs are safe from bad weather. They are also scalable, or modular, meaning that scientists can choose which sensors to attach to them depending on their research objectives. AUVs are also less expensive than research vessels, but they can complete identical repeat surveys of an area.Scientists can use sensors on an AUV to create maps of the ocean floor, record environmental information, sense what humans have left behind, identify hazards to navigation, explore geologic formations, and more.

      "As part of the TIETeK project run by Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft e.V., one of the many cell construction technologies available to CCI was used to build an energy-storage system for the primary supply of the deep-sea robot shown below. The lithium accumulators, the battery management system and the modular structure were designed so that pressures of up to 600 bar (corresponding to an operating depth of approx. 6000 m) acting on the system as a whole would not affect functionality. This application-specific characteristic meant the AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle) could be built to be pressure-tolerant, which brought with it major advantages in terms of manufacturing and costs. The AUV was designed for deep-sea resource exploration. The CCI’s preferred development partner, the Fraunhofer Institute for Silicon Technology, was responsible for developing the energy-storage system and designing the prototype vehicle.The construction concept of the TIETeK AUV is modular, all other modules – such as sensors, actuators, drive train and communications equipment – having been developed and built by other development partners.The energy supply is provided by four energy-storage systems connected in series. The individual modules consist of 12 cells and are connected with hermetically sealed cable plug connections. To achieve the desired pressure tolerance, the modules are surrounded by seawater so that the ambient pressure is transmitted to the energy-storage systems. The individual modules were tested at hydrostatic pressures of up to 600 bar and optimised for ambient temperatures of between 0°C and 50°C.The pentagonal geometry of the module utilises the space available more efficiently than conventional designs. Such a configuration gives a higher energy and power density at module level and also has a positive effect on the AUV’s centre of gravity. The encapsulated BMS is visible in the image.CCI’s cell construction technology fulfilled the requirement profile optimally, which meant achieving very high energy density and uniform power output and consumption, combined with moderate temperatures. We were also able to satisfy the need for a modern combination of high-energy materials for anode and cathode thanks to our outstanding coating technology for the manufacture of electrode foils and a flexible method of cell construction.The test criteria used include the voltage requirements and the resulting capacities in charge and discharge tests for different performance profiles. Cycle stabilities, temperature testing and life testing serve to characterise the cell properties, some of which are given below:More Information: http://en.customcells.de/anwendungsbeispiel/Voltage: 3.7Rechargeable: 1%PDF-1.3\r",

These robotic, unmanned submarine platforms provide access to areas that may otherwise not be explored and act as force multipliers, allowing one ship to research a greater area than would otherwise be possible. Falkor has hosted numerous AUVs from commercially available systems, to units still in development where modifications are being made aboard the ship between dives. The future will likely see autonomous systems which can perform many research functions without the support of a ship at all. Schmidt Ocean Institute is excited to help bring about these exciting new technologies.An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is an unmanned underwater robot that is capable of independently completing a pre-programmed mission. An AUV can work in tandem with other robotic systems to complete oceanographic research missions and provides excellent seafloor mapping and seawater characterization. Unlike ROVs, AUVs can travel without operator input once they are programed at the surface. They can collect a large amount of visual data through photomosaicing, as well as seawater data, depending on the sensors added.AUVs are small, easily portable vehicles. They are self-guiding and self-powered. They are less expensive than an ROV and able to maintain a direct trajectory through the water. AUVs are programmed beforehand and are not tethered to the ship. This allows much more data collection during a cruise, as the ship can focus on other tasks while the AUV is in the water. AUVs speed, mobility, and spatial range is stronger compared to ROVs. Since ROVs are tethered to the ship, they can draw more power and communicate real-time data. AUVs cannot operate everywhere. They can be influenced by strong currents. They also are less suited for areas that heavily populated due to acoustic interference, collision risk, and entanglement. AUVs can operate a wide range of times depending on its purpose and payload – Some for a few hours, others over several days. They use different kinds of batteries – some are even solar charged – to power different types of moment or propulsion. Before deployment into the water, they are programmed at the surface and can work independently until the mission is completed.Once the AUV has returned, the engineers and scientists can directly download the data off the AUV onto the computers aboard the ship. The data is raw and needs processing but can be used as quickly as needed. At the end of the mission, usually the AUV is programmed to surface. The engineers aboard the ship track the AUV to its surfacing position. Then the crew deploys the work boat to collect the AUV and hoist it back on board the research vessel.RT @StanfordEarth “I’ve thought, ‘can I do this?’ because there aren’t many people that look me doing earth and environmental science...I had to push past that and realize I am good enough, smart enough, and capable enough to do this,” @DrAlexisWilson told @theAGU. bit.ly/2L4dOsg pic.twitter.com/1Pyq…About 5 hours ago via Twitter Web App · \n",

      "On the ocean floor, at this very minute, fleets of robots roam free—independent of human operators. These machines, called autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, have battery-powered sensors on board to detect and take instant measurements of various oceanic properties, providing data for scientific studies. Many AUV surveys take place each year in areas of interest, such as deep-sea vents, cracks in the seafloor that expose the hot, volcanic rock below.One important use of AUVs is in detecting anomalies to help pinpoint the location of harmful chemical discharges under the sea. For example, oil wells bored into Earth’s surface or natural gas stored underground for later use are susceptible to leaks. Also, fish farms (such as the massive, circular pens housing salmon and trout in the fjords of Norway) may leak organic waste and other pollutants into marine ecosystems.Detecting these anomalies is a tough job, however. AUVs have limited battery life, so simply covering large distances to try to locate discharges or a false alarm comes at a cost. Plus, ocean dynamics—tides, currents, and winds—change constantly. This change affects the movement and mixing of seawater, making the detection of potential leaks even more challenging.Here Alendal suggests some strategies for designing AUV surveys to better detect anomalies in the ocean and to do so in a cost-effective way. The strategies involve creating a map of potential discharge locations in a given area and assigning a probability of them leaking. The author also suggests defining a small background probability to account for leaks from unknown locations, for example, when gas ascends to the seafloor through lateral conduits that create discharges farther afield.In addition, predictions on how the discharge will be transported and diluted in the water column are needed, along with specs that describe an instrument’s capacity to detect a leak, because these will define the area in the neighborhood of a leak in which the leak may be detected. Then, once AUVs are deployed, the author envisions a system in which each measurement failing to detect a seep will update the underlying map of probable discharge locations, using Bayes’s theorem, and the location for the next measurement with the highest probability of detecting a discharge can be selected. Within such an operating plan, the AUV’s efforts can be maximized, allowing operators to balance the relative costs between making measurements and traveling long distances.The author tested these strategies using simulations of the North Sea. For the test, 15 possible discharge locations were chosen randomly in a 130-square-kilometer area of seafloor, representing oil and gas wells perforating the seafloor with the highest risk of leaking the stored gas.In the demonstration, the author used a general circulation model to predict the gas transport and dilution of a leak away from a source. Prior research has used the same framework of simulations to design programs that monitor leaks with fixed instrumentation. Here the author demonstrates how such simulations can assist in defining survey paths for moving platforms, such as AUVs.This study provides a pathway toward improving AUV surveys of areas of interest along the seafloor. The method it outlines has the potential not only to allow these vehicles to locate gas leaks and other targets with greater precision but to do so at a lower cost to private companies, universities, and other organizations.

      "            This is a PentaChart on reactor power for large displacement autonomous underwater vehicles. Currently AUVs use batteries or combinations of batteries and fuel cells for power. Battery/fuel cell technology is limited by duration. Batteries and cell fuels are a good match for some missions, but other missions could benefit greatly by a longer duration. The goal is the following: to design nuclear systems to power an AUV and meet design constraints including non-proliferation issues, power level, size constraints, and power conversion limitations. The action plan is to continue development of a range of systems for terrestrial systems and focus on a system for Titan Moon as alternative to Pu-238 for NASA.Similar records in OSTI.GOV collections:Help | Advanced SearcharXiv® is a registered trademark of Cornell University.If you have a disability and are having trouble accessing information on this website or need materials in an alternate format,\n",

People should like them because they're really cool, but they do like them because they're comparatively inexpensive.Expanding Seaglider CapabilitiesA Unique PlatformAPL-UW scientists continually expand Seagliderâs hardware and software systems, and sensor packages. Recent additions:Seaglider has proven itself adaptable to a wide range of conditions with many sensors that were never originally intended to be part of the vehicle. It has a track record for very long missions and reliability in extreme ocean environments. It has been used effectively in strong western boundary currents, under ice cover, strong tidal currents, and relatively shallow water. These operating environments were not part of the original design, but the pursuit of specific science questions and engineering excellence have pushed the platform to perform new research missions.Seaglider CommercializationMarketsIn May 2013, UWâs Center for Commercialization licensed the manufacture of Seagliders to Kongsberg Underwater Technology, Inc. granting them sole rights to produce, market and continue the development of Seaglider technology. Commercialization will take Seagliders wider into the environmental monitoring arena and the oil and gas industry. The UW Seaglider Fabrication Center will continue to build and service Seagliders for UW researchers and to service units sold before the Kongsberg licensing.\n",
      "Krongsberg Underwater Technology, Inc. A Novel Propulsion MethodThere have been nearly 200 Seagliders manufactured. The vehicle was first developed for oceanographic research  taking measurements of conductivity or equivalent salinity, temperature, phytoplankton concentration, oxygen concentration, etc. More recently, the U.S. Navy has used the vehicle to detect and monitor marine mammals in their operating areas, some of which are remote and/or covered in bad weather, which make visual observations impossible. The oil and gas industry is an emerging market for Seaglider, where it may be used to monitor environmental conditions for offshore operations.Animation of Seaglider Mode of Operation This animation demonstrates how Seaglider moves through the ocean and communicates with satellites to transmit data and determine its global position. As Seaglider dives and ascends its wings cause it to glide, allowing horizontal movement. Internal sensors monitor the depth, heading and attitude of the vehicle. External sensors are constantly scanning the ocean to determine water properties. The animation is a 3D simulation of how Seaglider maneuvers. Cut-away views of the internal mechanics show how Seaglider pitches, rolls, dives, ascends, and surfaces.\n",
      "(Note: There is no audio.)YouTube video (run-time 4:15)Seagliders fly through the water with extremely modest energy requirements using changes in buoyancy for thrust coupled with a stable, low-drag, hydrodynamic shape. Designed to operate at depths up to 1000 meters, the hull compresses as it sinks, matching the compressibility of seawater.The AUV Seaglider is the result of a collaborative effort between APL-UW and the UW School of Oceanography. These small, free-swimming vehicles can gather conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) data from the ocean for months at a time and transmit it to shore in near-real time via satellite data telemetry.Seagliders make oceanographic measurements traditionally collected by research vessels or moored instruments, but at a fraction of the cost. They can survey along a transect, profile at a fixed location, and can be commanded to alter their sampling strategies throughout a mission.ApplicationsOperational ModesMilestonesMore About This ResearchSeaglider Current Operations Seagliders operate in the worldâs oceans.

The agreement was announced this month by Kongsberg and the UW Center for Commercialization.Seaglider was developed in 1997 by researchers at the School of Oceanography and Applied Physics Laboratory. In UW research the device has set records for the distance traveled and time spent alone at sea, using buoyancy to glide up and down through the ocean while using minimal power.Kongsberg will pick up where previous licensee iRobot left off, handling orders for customers external to the UW. The Norwegian-owned company plans to hire five or six new employees to build Seagliders at its Lynwood facility.  The UW Seaglider Fabrication Center, managed by Fritz Stahr, will continue to employ three full-time staff members and two students to build and service Seagliders for UW researchers, and to service units sold before there was a commercial provider for the technology.Kongsberg obtains rights to commercialize Seaglider technologywww.km.kongsberg.comKongsberg Underwater Technology, Inc. announced today that it has successfully completed negotiations with the University of Washington's Center for Commercialization to obtain the sole rights to produce, market and continue the development of Seaglider technology.16 May 2013State's most sophisticated buoy to sample for acidification, oxygen-starved watersUW News and Information, Sandra HinesThe most sophisticated array of instruments ever put in Washington waters has been mounted on a buoy and Seaglider that will be deployed this week off the coast near La Push, in water that typically makes its way into Puget Sound, according to Jan Newton.12 Jul 2010Seaglider Monitors Climate-Related Ocean Circulation in the ArcticU.S. News & World ReportAn intelligent, ocean-going glider has spent six months on a record-breaking deployment to sample the icy waters off western Greenland.10 Jun 2009UW Seaglider is milestone in climate change researchSeattle Post-Intelligencer, Monica GuzmanScientists are concerned that climate change might increase the amount of fresh water exiting the Arctic so much that it could change the density of the Labrador Sea, altering the circulation of the world's oceans. Data obtained by UW's Seagliders will help in showing just how quickly that could be happening.29 Apr 2009Fun with robots!KUOW Radio, Seattle, Steve ScherThe University of Washington unveils its latest underwater inventions, RoboFish and Seagliders, and makes strides in robotic technology.

Because acoustic methods permit detection of animals underwater, at night, and in poor weather conditions, passive acoustic observation has been used increasingly often over the last decade to study marine mammal distribution, abundance, and movements, as well as for mitigation of potentially harmful anthropogenic effects. However, there is demand for new, cost-effective tools that allow scientists to monitor areas of interest autonomously with high temporal and spatial resolution in near-real time. Here we describe an autonomous underwater vehicle  a glider  equipped with an acoustic sensor and onboard data processing capabilities to passively scan an area for marine mammals in near-real time. The instrument developed here can be used to cost-effectively screen areas of interest for marine mammals for several months at a time. The near-real-time detection and reporting capabilities of the glider can help to protect marine mammals during potentially harmful anthropogenic activities such as seismic exploration for sub-sea fossil fuels or naval sonar exercises. Furthermore, the glider is capable of under-ice operation, allowing investigation of otherwise inaccessible polar environments that are critical habitats for many endangered marine mammal species.Determining vertical water velocities from SeagliderFrajka-Williams, E., C.C. Eriksen, P.B. Rhines, and R.R. Harcourt, \"Determining vertical water velocities from Seaglider,\" J. Atmos. Ocean. Technol., 28, 1641-1656, doi:10.1175/2011JTECHO830.1, 2011.More Info1 Dec 2011Vertical velocities in the world's oceans are typically small, less than 1 cm s-1, posing a significant challenge for observational techniques. Seaglider, an autonomous profiling instrument, can be used to estimate vertical water velocity in the ocean. Using a Seaglider's flight model and pressure observations, vertical water velocities are estimated along glider trajectories in the Labrador Sea before, during, and after deep convection. Results indicate that vertical velocities in the stratified ocean agree with the theoretical WentzelKramersBrillouin (WKB) scaling of w; and in the turbulent mixed layer, scale with buoyancy, and wind forcing. It is estimated that accuracy is to within 0.5 cm s-1. Because of uncertainties in the flight model, velocities are poor near the surface and deep apogees, and during extended roll maneuvers. Some of this may be improved by using a dynamic flight model permitting acceleration and by better constraining flight parameters through pilot choices during the mission.Passive-acoustic monitoring of odontocetes using a Seaglider: First results of a field test in Hawaiian waters.Klink, H., D.K.

Am., 129,  2536, doi:10.1121/1.3588409, 2011.More Info1 Apr 2011In fall 2009 the University of Washington, Applied Physics Laboratory conducted in collaboration with the Oregon State University, a comprehensive field test of a passive-acoustic Seaglider along the western shelf-break of the island of Hawaii. During the 3 week mission, a total of approximately 170 h of broadband acoustic data [194 kHz sampling rate] were collected. The recordings were manually analyzed by an experienced analyst for beaked whale (Ziphiidae), dolphin (Delphinidae), and sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) echolocation clicks as well as echo sounder pings emitted by boats in the area. Here we present and discuss first results of these data analysis, which revealed that more than 50% of the recorded files (each of 1-minute duration) contain bioacoustic signals. Furthermore the recorded data and the results of the manual analysis are used to validate and optimize an automated classifier for odontocete echolocation clicks, which was developed in a collaborative effort with San Diego State University. The algorithm is intended to be implemented on the Seaglider to enable species identification by classifying detected echolocation clicks in (near) real-time during sea trials.Field Tests of the Glider Technology Transition Initiative Prototype SeagliderWood, A.S., and K.

Oceanogr., 53, 2169-2179, doi:10.4319/lo.2008.53.5_part_2.2169, 2008.More Info1 Sep 2008From September 2003 to December 2007, autonomous, underwater Seaglider continuously ran a V-shaped transect off Washington State from about 200-m water depth (i.e., at the break between the shelf and slope) to offshore waters with depths >2700 m. Seaglider visited the offshore vertex at 47°N, 128°W, where our observations concentrated, approximately monthly. Seaglider measured temperature, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen to 1000 m and also recorded chlorophyll a (Chl a) fluorescence and particulate optical backscatter to 150 m. Distinct interannual variation was documented in timing and depths of winter mixing, transition to a shallow summer pycnocline, and onset of mixed-layer erosion in autumn. Chl a concentrations estimated from fluorescence were directly comparable among the seven laboratory-calibrated sensors used, but their estimates exceeded concurrent, satellite-derived concentrations by a factor of three. Seaglider optical profiles enabled interpretation of satellite imagery by revealing that the apparent autumn bloom after destratification was instead a vertical redistribution of phytoplankton from the subsurface maximum to a depth where they could be observed by satellites. Results of 4 yr of sampling within 25 km of the vertex demonstrate the value of gliders in ocean observing and their capability to carry out multiyear, fully autonomous operations under any sea state. The true power of glider programs will be realized in combination with other measurement platforms, including larger spatial coverage by satellites and more comprehensive biogeochemical measurements from moorings and occasional ship-based sampling.Using Seagliders for acoustic receiving and communicationHowe, B.M., and M.L. Boyd, \"Using Seagliders for acoustic receiving and communication,\" J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 123, 3913, 2008.More Info1 May 2008Underwater gliders are beginning to be used as tools in ocean acoustics and acoustical oceanography. Results from several experiments conducted in summer 2006 with Seagliders equipped with acoustic modems and receivers are described. Off Kauai, a glider received signals from the Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate/North Pacific Acoustic Laboratory 75 Hz source; subsequent coherent processing showed close to theoretical gain for 12 min records while moving away from the source at ranges >100 km with velocity 20 cm/s (measured by travel time, Doppler, and dead reckoning). In the Monterey Bay MB06 experiment, two-way communications between other subsea platforms and shore via the acoustic modem-equipped glider was demonstrated (albeit with latency). The results support the future use of gliders as precision navigated platforms, communication and time distribution nodes, and thermometry/tomography mobile receivers.Including whale call detection in standard ocean measurements: Application of acoustic SeaglidersMoore, S.E., B.M. Howe, K.M. Stafford, and M.L. Boyd, \"Including whale call detection in standard ocean measurements: Application of acoustic Seagliders,\" Mar. Tech. Soc. J., 41, 49-53, doi:10.4031/002533207787442033, 2007.More Info1 Dec 2007Over the past decade, fixed recorders have come into increasing use for long-term sampling of whale calls in remote ocean regions. Concurrently, the development of several types of autonomous underwater vehicles has demonstrated measurement capabilities that promise to revolutionize ocean science. These two lines of technical development were merged with the addition of broadband (5 Hz to 30 kHz) omni-directional hydrophones to seagliders. In August 2006, the capability of three Acoustic Seagliders (ASGs) to detect whale calls was tested in an experiment offshore Monterey, California. In total, 401 dives were completed and over 107 hours of acoustic data recorded. Blue whale calls were detected on all but two of the 76 dives where acoustic data were analyzed in detail, while humpback and sperm whale calls were detected on roughly 20% of those dives. Various whistles, clicks and burst calls, similar to those produced by dolphins and small whales, were also detected, suggesting that the capability of ASGs can be expanded to sample a broad range of marine mammal species. The potential to include whale call detection in the suite of standard oceanographic measures is unprecedented and provides a foundation for mobile sampling strategies at scales that better match the vertical and horizontal movements of the whales themselves. This capability opens new doors for investigation of cetacean habitats and their role in marine ecosystems, as envisioned in future ocean observing systems.Seaglider: a long-range autonomous underwater vehicle for oceanographic researchEriksen, C.C.,  T.J.

Eng., 26, 424 - 436, doi:10.1109/48.972073, 2001.More Info1 Oct 2001Seagliders are small, reusable autonomous underwater vehicles designed to glide from the ocean surface to a programmed depth and back while measuring temperature, salinity, depth-averaged current, and other quantities along a sawtooth trajectory through the water. Their low hydrodynamic drag and wide pitch control range allow glide slopes in the range 0.2 to 3. They are designed for missions in a range of several thousand kilometers and durations of many months. Seagliders are commanded remotely and report their measurements in near real time via wireless telemetry. The development and operation of Seagliders and the results of field trials in Puget Sound are reported.Seaglider Observations During Summer 2000Eriksen, C.C., R.D. Light, T.W. Lehman, T. Wen, M.J.

The size and power consumption of desired chemical and biological sensors precluded the use of existing long-range gliders, and the endurance requirement precluded the use of more traditional propeller-driven AUVs. The concept for the vehicle was a highly energy-efficient propeller-driven AUV capable of operating at speeds between 0.5 and 1.0 meters per second. The vehicle, named Tethys, conducted its first brief autonomous mission in December 2009, just offshore of Moss Landing.Ben Yair Raanan, Brian Kieft, and Brett Hobson prior to the deployment of three long-range autonomous underwater vehicles from the R/V Paragon in Monterey Bay. Photo by Todd Walsh.The range and endurance of the long-range AUV (LRAUV) greatly expands the types of observations and experiments possible with autonomous platforms. For instance, one of the institute’s AUVs carries a comprehensive suite of sensors out to MBARI’s M2 mooring and back. Tethys will carry a smaller, but still impressive suite of sensors 10 times farther, extending the reach of MBARI’s shore-launched AUVs into the California Current system. This expands researchers’ non-ship observational capability beyond the upwelling shadow, well into the oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) ocean. This capability also provides a foundation for studying phytoplankton blooms from boom to bust, by providing a mobile platform that can survey a bloom continuously through the two week- to month-long lifetime of a bloom.The LRAUV is designed to address the need for improved biological process experiments by providing a platform capable of sampling at the appropriate time and space scales with both in situ sensors and water samplers. The endurance of the vehicle and its variety of operating modes provide it with the endurance to wait in a low-power configuration for biological events to occur, and the flexibility to respond to detected events to characterize processes from initiation to collapse of a bloom. Thus the LRAUV, combined with new sensors and samplers will enable a new generation of biological process experiments.The LRAUV is, to the best of our understanding, exceeding the original proposal targets. Most notably, researchers estimated a range of 1,000 kilometers at 0.75 meters per second, and now project an ultimate range of more than 2,000 kilometers at one meter per second with primary batteries.Researchers operate the Tethys near the bottom of MBARI’s 10-meter-deep test tank. © MBARI 2009In contrast to existing AUVs or gliders, Tethys is optimized around a “high-power” payload power consumption of about eight watts. Power management is integral to the vehicle, and the ability to operate sensors intermittently or not at all to reduce power consumption is key to achieving large ranges and endurance.Thus high-power sensors which consume tens of watts can be operated without sacrifice of endurance provided that they are operated intermittently. Core electronics for the vehicle have been customized to minimize power consumption, and even the microprocessor selected can be “throttled down” to low clock speeds to minimize power consumption when feasible (at low speed or during drifting). Further, extensive efforts have gone in to minimizing the propulsion power. Strategies include reduced drag through the development of a low-drag afterbody, minimizing appendages, and the development of control strategies that minimize induced drag. A custom propeller design and a gearless propulsion motor optimized for efficient low-speed operations complete the low propulsion power efforts. Operationally, the Tethys is intended to be used much like a glider, using a satellite link to communicate with shore (perhaps a few times a day might be typical).Research programs at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) encompass the entire ocean, from the surface waters to the deep seafloor, and from the coastal zone to the open sea. The need to understand the ocean in all its complexity and variability drives MBARI's research and development efforts.Skip to Main Content\n",
